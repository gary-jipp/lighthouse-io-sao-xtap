# React useReducer

- [ ] Review of React Exercise #3
- [ ] What problem are we trying to solve with `useReducer`?
- [ ] Useful with complex states with many update operations
- [ ] Also when you want to use the previous state
- [ ] Less useful for simple state
- [ ] Component no longer needs to deal with "how" state is updated, only request that it be done
- [ ] Allows fewer state update fuctions props to be used with components
- [ ] "reduces" all the state management down to a single function `dispatch`
